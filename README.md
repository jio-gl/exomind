# Exomind - Brief Intro

Exomind is a tool designed to deliver targetted phising attacks through social networks. In order to do this we must first retrieve information from them in an OSINT fashi
on, this information is then used to impersonate key individuals whose fake online profiles can be used as the delivery medium for links into handcrafted webpages.


The most sophisticated attack that we have implemented so far is a sub-network replication attack, this means we are not only impersonating one individual, but also creating fake profiles for a big-enough part of his subnetwork. This lets us detach from profiles of real people who may perceive the attack, and also gives us more control on the topology of the network.
