# exomind
Exomind is a tool designed to deliver targetted phising attacks through social networks. In order to do this we must first retrieve information from them in an OSINT fashion, this information is then used to impersonate key individuals whose fake online profiles can be used as the delivery medium for links into handcrafted webpages.
